# grades-tracker
Web app that allows computer science students of UWr to track their studies progress. Made as a final project for the Advanced Python course. I'm planning to rewrite it completely with MERN stack.   
Application allows you to:
- add new subjects, edit existing, track your points progress 
- add/edit task sheets and received grades 
- add your schedule 
- see your progress and better manage your work flow
